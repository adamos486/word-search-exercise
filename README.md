# Word Search

This project serves as a technical question that is easily understandable in a non-technical way as most everyone has at one point done a word search or at least can pick up on how to play this game.

The purpose of this problem is to test the ability to take what is a common action that most everyone can do (search a board of characters for a list of words) and transcribe it into code. Further, small optimizations can be searched for while writing the code, and tests can be written before hand if TDD is desired. 

Please add tests for whatever solution you write so we can see your thought process.

Hint:
- Can you solve for finding just 1 word given the board and a target word?
- How can you optimize functional code or reuse of code?

## Conclussion
**Purpose**:
Check ability to translate clear human process (solving a word search) into code

**Difficulty**:
Medium

**Time Expectation**:
40-60 mins
